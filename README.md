## MonoDepthMask
A Dataset for multi-task learning of Monocular Depth Estimation and Mask Prediction. 
The data was generated by taking:
   - ~100 random background images
   - ~110 random foreground images + flipped images of these originals (Total = 220)
   - Overlaying these 100 fg images on each of the background at 20 different places (Yup! sometimes you could see poeple flying)
   - Using [DenseDepth](https://github.com/ialhashim/DenseDepth) model to generate Depth maps of the overlayed images
   
### Dataset Description

- **bg_image:** Images with Only Background E.g: Malls, classrooms, college_outdoors, lobbies etc;
- **fg_bg_images:** Images with an object/person overlayed randomly on a Background
- **mask_images:** Ground truth of Masked Images of foregroud object/person.
- **depth_images:** Ground truth of Depth Map generated from fg_bg_images.

## Dataset Generation Process
* How to create transparent foreground images:
	* Download PNG/JPG format images of people with any background
	* Upload individual images to https://www.remove.bg/upload 
	* Since I was using the free version so images had to be transformed one at a time
	* Download and save the transparent images
* How to create masks for above foreground images:
	* Used a simple OpenCV based [conversion](https://github.com/rajy4683/MonoMaskDepth/blob/c58e18fd0357453ae09f643c3f1ca8e53db7fcf4/monomaskdepthutils.py#L118)
   ```
   def generate_mask(img,debug=False):    
      lower_white = np.array([1, 1,1,4])
      upper_white = np.array([255,255,255,4])
      mask = cv2.inRange(img, lower_white, upper_white)
      if debug == True:
         cv2_imshow(img)
         cv2_imshow(mask)
      return mask
   ```
* How were fg overlayed over bg and created 20 variants:
   * Please refer to [this notebook](https://github.com/rajy4683/MonoMaskDepth/blob/master/DataGeneratorPipeline.ipynb) for end-to-end flow
   * Primarily used albumentations to generate flipped images and for resizing images to fit the background. Code can be found [here](https://github.com/rajy4683/MonoMaskDepth/blob/c58e18fd0357453ae09f643c3f1ca8e53db7fcf4/monomaskdepthutils.py#L188)
   * Main advantage of albumentation was that it operates on masks/bboxes also in the same operation
   * FG images were of the size (125,125) or (64,64)
   * Range of 20 random positions within ((0, height_bg - height_fg), (0, width_bg - width_fg)) was used to prevent images being cropped at the edge. Code can be found [here](https://github.com/rajy4683/MonoMaskDepth/blob/c58e18fd0357453ae09f643c3f1ca8e53db7fcf4/monomaskdepthutils.py#L227)
   * A csv file with a tuple of every background with 40 positions (flipped + regular) was created.
   * Slices of this CSV file was run parallely on 4 Colab instances to generate 4 files listed in [this section](https://github.com/rajy4683/MonoMaskDepth/blob/master/README.md#fg_bg_images-and-mask_images).
      + All the files generated were stored locally on the colab instance
      + All the input files were copied at the start of the run to the colab instance's local directory
      + The files were later zipped and saved back on to Google drive.
      + Currently analyzing how to make this process faster and streamlined
   * To overcome disk space and colab file handling issue,

* How did you create your depth images?
   * Base Model used was [DenseDepth](https://github.com/ialhashim/DenseDepth/blob/master/DenseDepth.ipynb)
   * The test utilities were modified to handle the following:
      * From input zip files generated above, directly read ~300 images
      * Resize these images using albumentations to 480x640 
      * Run the model on the inputs and save the output depth data in 'plasma' cmap. This will be modified to grayscale.
      * Similar to above step, this step was also run of 4 colab instances in parallel to generate respective depth images
      * Code for this handling can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QpcN8SE82asljEr5_m_yOFkWE3jvnJhq?authuser=1#scrollTo=vR3sAKJX_CZY)
* How did you calculate mean and stddev?
   * Code for computation can be found in this [notebook](https://github.com/rajy4683/MonoMaskDepth/blob/master/DataSetMeanStd.ipynb)
   * PyTorch based [DepthDataset class](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KiGtCEeq7jKETSa0OZTuzqyXkCDNkSrP#scrollTo=koNkddWf9Slj&line=8&uniqifier=1) was created
   * This allows to use either PyTorch dataloaders/plain iterators to be used over the entire dataset.
   * Using [Knuth's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance), the mean and stddev were calculated over each channel of all the images.
   * The dataset loading and iteration is currently very slow and will need to be improved drastically.
